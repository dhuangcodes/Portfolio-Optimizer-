Portfolio Optimizer (Modern Portfolio Theory)

A Python model to find the ideal asset allocation for a given set of stocks, based on Modern Portfolio Theory.

Key Features:
* Ran a **Monte Carlo Simulation** of 25,000 random portfolios using `numpy`.
* Calculated the **Sharpe Ratio** for each portfolio to identify the "Optimal Portfolio."
* Used `pandas` to calculate annualized returns, risk, and the **covariance matrix** from 5+ years of historical data.
* Plotted all 25,000 simulations with `matplotlib` to visualize the **"Efficient Frontier."**
